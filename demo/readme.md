# Demos of numpy-cnn
Here we release some supported demos.

## CRAFT text detector
Demo for scene text detector with model [CRAFT](https://github.com/clovaai/CRAFT-pytorch).
Run ```python main.py``` inside folder ```craft_text_detector```. 3 files (same level folder with ```main.py```) are needed (craft.txt, [craft.npy](), [craft_bn.npy]())
The detected result is shown as following:
